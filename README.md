# Password-Generator

## Description

My goal was to develop a button that, after prompted on what types of characters to include, would generate and output a random string that could be used as a password.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

1. You load the page and click the "Generate" button.

2. You will answer a series of OK or Cancel prompts to determine which types of characters you would like to include in the generated password. OK = Yes // Cancel = No.

3. You will input a number ranging 8-128 for how many characters you would like your password to be in length.

4. You password will be generated in a pop-out alert box from which you can copy for use.

5. This process is repeatable indefinitely.
